## Build a basic version of MoneyTransfer

## Developed as a practice ground for mastering key BE concepts,

focusing on robust functionality and data integrity, I have Crafted this fullstack MERN application using these key technologies:

MongoDB Transactional Guarantee: Ensures consistent money transfers, even in the event of unexpected interruptions, preventing lost funds.

Real-time Balance Updates: With every transfer, balances are automatically deducted from the sender's account and credited to the recipient's account, ensuring accurate and up-to-date balance tracking.

User Search Functionality: Easily find and connect with other users using our intuitive search feature, making sending money to friends and family a breeze.

ZOD Input Validation: Maintains data accuracy by rigorously validating user information.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Implements secure user authentication and authorization throughout the application.

bcrypt Password Hashing: Protects user credentials with industry-standard encryption methods.

Custom Authentication Middleware: Provides an extra layer of security, controlling access to sensitive operations.

Advanced User Search: Seamlessly locate recipients using flexible query parameters.
